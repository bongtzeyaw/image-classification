# image-classification
A project implementing convolutional neural network using Keras on TensorFlow to classify an image (cat or dog). This project aims to utilise pre-trained model (MobileNet V2 developed by Google) and build output layer upon it. We also perform Data Augmentation to avoid overfitting and create a larger dataset
